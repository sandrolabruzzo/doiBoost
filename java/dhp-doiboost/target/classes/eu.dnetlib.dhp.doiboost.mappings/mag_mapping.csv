Papers/FieldOfStudy/DisplayName,"Result/subject with Qualifier(""keyword"", ""dnet:subject_classification_typologies"")",Some FieldOfStudy come from the UMLS controlled vocabulary. Future releases of DOIBoost will include such terms with a specific Qualifier (i.e. not as generic keywords)
Papers/FieldOfStudy/MainType,"Result/subject with Qualifier(""keyword"", ""dnet:subject_classification_typologies"")","If MainType is splittable on . (like 'food.type_of_dish', 'aviation.airport', 'soccer.team'), then the first token (i.e. food, aviation, soccer) is also added as additional subject."
